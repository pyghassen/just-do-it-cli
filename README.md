Just do it was created to solve some of the most common issues that us developers have to deal with.

You guessed it right, this tool gonna change the fact that you have to deal with "zoom meetings", "google meet" or whatever meetings on daily basis.

Sounds intriguing?

I think a lot of people have solved that in more creative way, just check tiktok or maybe youtube if you are an old fart.

However Just Do It CLI will help you deal with some of the annoying things like switching focus and organizing your daily tasks without the mental torture of using a corporate tool like Jira.

How you gonna achieve that, that's a fair question, here's how it works.
